/*
We consider an undirected tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N, Additionally, each node also has a label attached to it and the label is an integer value. Note that different nodes can have identical labels. You need to write a function , that , given a zero-indexed array A of length N, where A[J] is the label value of the (J + 1)-th node in the tree, and a zero-indexed array E of length K = (N - 1) * 2 in which the edges of the tree are described (for every 0 <= j <= N -2 values E[2 * J] and E[2 * J + 1] represents and edge connecting node E[2 * J] with node E[2 * J + 1])， returns the length of the longest path such that all the nodes on that path have the same label. Then length of a path if defined as the number of edges in that path.

 Notice

Assume that: 1 <= N <= 1000

Example
Give A = [1, 1, 1 ,2, 2] and E = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]
described tree appears as follows:

                   1 （value = 1）
                 /   \
    (value = 1) 2     3 (value = 1)
               /  \
 (value = 2)  4     5 (value = 2)
and your function should return 2, because the longest path (in which all nodes have the save value of 1) is (2 -> 1 -> 3). The number of edges on this path is 2, thus, that is the answer.
