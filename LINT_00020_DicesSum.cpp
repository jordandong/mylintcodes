/*
Throw n dices, the sum of the dices' faces is S. Given n, find the all possible value of S along with its probability.

Notice
You do not care about the accuracy of the result, we will help you to output results.

Example
Given n = 1, return [ [1, 0.17], [2, 0.17], [3, 0.17], [4, 0.17], [5, 0.17], [6, 0.17]].
