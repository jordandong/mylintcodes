/*
Given a string, count number of subsequences of the form a^i b^j c^ k,
i.e., it consists of i a characters, followed by j b characters, followed by k c characters where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.

Note: Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.

Example
Given s = abbc, return 3
Subsequences are abc, abc and abbc

Given s = abcabc, return 7
Subsequences are abc, abc, abbc, aabc, abcc, abc and abc
