/*
A positive integer is a palindrome if its decimal representation (without leading zeros) is a palindromic string (a string that reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, the numbers 5, 77, 363, 4884, 11111, 12121 and 349943 are palindromes.

A range of integers is interesting if it contains an even number of palindromes. The range [L, R], with L <= R, is defined as the sequence of integers from L to R (inclusive): (L, L+1, L+2, …, R-1, R). L and R are the range’s first and last numbers.

The range [L1, R1] is a subrange of [L, R] if L <= L1 <= R1 <= R. Your job is to determine how many interesting subranges of [L, R] there are.

Example
Given L = 1, R = 2, return 1
Given L = 1, R = 7, return 12
Given L = 87, R = 88, return 1
